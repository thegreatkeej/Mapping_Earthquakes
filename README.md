# Mapping_Earthquakes
Using an API and GeoJson data collected to create an interactive earthquake map.
## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to practice  using leaflet on several different JSON files. The outcome is a script that can grab earthquake data and create a color coded map with pop-ups.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes
Visually, you can see that the majority of earthquakes occur along tectonic plates.

## Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

### Challenge
I didn't like the colors(given) in the assignment. I searched online for 
different color pallettes, chose the ones I liked and refactored the code.

### Difficulty
I am still getting used to itteration so some of the loops were hard for me.
But I am getting better with more practice.

## Results
This html shows a dynamic map of earthquakes with convienient pop-ups and a color
coded display.
