# Mapping_Earthquakes
Using an API and GeoJson data collected to create an interactive earthquake map.
(Check out the live html! => https://thegreatkeej.github.io/Mapping_Earthquakes/ )
## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to practice using leaflet on several different JSON files. The outcome is a script that can grab earthquake data and create a color coded map with pop-ups.
In the  right-hand corner, is a drop-down that allows the user to toggle between "Street" view, "Dark", "Light" and "Satelitestreets." Also, the same drop-down allows the user to filter the map to show, all recent earthquakes, earthquakes above a 4 magnitude and an outline of tectonic plate location.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes
Visually, you can see that there is a pattern of earthquake activity. The majority of earthquakes occur along tectonic plates and in distant seas.

## Difficulties Encountered

### Difficulty
I am still getting used to itteration, but I am getting better with more practice.

## Summary
This html shows a dynamic map of earthquakes with convienient pop-ups and a color coded display. The same coding could be used in numerous applications: driving, mapping land marks, mapping weather or storms, etc.
